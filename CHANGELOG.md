# Changelog

All notable changes to Nbody6Dynamics.jl. Follows semantic versioning;
pre-1.0 minor versions may break APIs (private project, no-compat policy).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-07

First version pushed to the private remote (CI/CD shakedown).

### Added
- Fail-fast configuration validation naming the offending `section.key`.
- Static QA in the test suite (Aqua, ExplicitImports, JET package-scoped);
  StableRNGs test streams; real-output fixtures for every reader.
- Escaper analysis suite (cumulative mass loss, velocity–time, escape
  anisotropy from the new angle columns) and SSE-quantity plots
  (mass segregation via RI [pc], evolutionary clock t/T_MS, core masses).
- Journal column-width figure presets with true-print-size PDF export;
  horizontal top-outside legends; decade log ticks; Okabe–Ito semantic
  colour system; physical-units axes (pc / Myr / km s⁻¹ / M☉) by default.
- Provenance: package + backend commit stamps in run metadata;
  `export_for_paper` with provenance sidecars; structured per-run logging.
- Merger IC generator: validated King sampler (c(W0) to <1% of published
  values), Kroupa IMF modes, Kepler/explicit orbits, seeded reproducibility
  through to Nbody6's NRAND.

### Changed
- Package renamed Nbody6Setup.jl → Nbody6Dynamics.jl (2026-08-02).
- Backend refreshed to upstream v2026.07; sev.83 reader targets the
  15-token format exclusively (RI in pc; TM/MC/RCC/RE fields).
- Formatter-enforced style (`.JuliaFormatter.toml`); benchmarks moved to
  a bench-local environment.

### Removed
- Dead HDF5 reader path; "astro"/KZ(22)=10 output branch; legacy seed
  sentinel; compatibility shims (private-project no-compat policy).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-24

Pre-remediation baseline (Nbody6Setup.jl): install/build pipeline, conf.3
and diagnostics readers, initial plotting, first merger-IC implementation.
